## Project Objective
-   The purpose of the analysis is to create a model that can predict the casualty severity through the analysis and examine key indicators. The data can be used to determine the ideal value of compensation according to the Injury Severity of the customer, and to prepare for emergency treatment. Also if we know the type of accident which has high severity, we can prevent additional accidents.
